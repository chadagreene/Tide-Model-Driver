% This tutorial covers how to detide and interpret ADCP (current) measurements
% near Getz Ice Shelf, Antarctica. Here we use the CATS tide model, but you
% can just as easily use any other TMD3.0 compatible if you wish.
%
% <TMD_Contents.html Back to Tide Model Driver Contents>.
%% View data file contents
% The first step when exploring any new dataset is to see what's in the 
% data file. Use |ncdisp| to find out: 

ncdisp('ADCP_S112.nc')

%% Load data
% Above you see that the units of time are days since Jan 1, 1950. So when
% we import time into Matlab's datenum format, just add the datenum of Jan
% 1, 1950. Load all the other data too. 

t = ncread('ADCP_S112.nc','time') + datenum(1950,1,1,0,0,0); 
lat = ncread('ADCP_S112.nc','lat'); 
lon = ncread('ADCP_S112.nc','lon'); 
z = ncread('ADCP_S112.nc','z'); 
u = ncread('ADCP_S112.nc','u'); 
v = ncread('ADCP_S112.nc','v'); 

%% Plot current speed
% Plot "speed" as the hypotenuse of u and v: 

figure
pcolor(t,z,hypot(u,v))
shading interp
ylabel 'depth (m)'
datetick('x','mmm-yyyy')
cb = colorbar; 
ylabel(cb,'Current speed (m/s)')
caxis([0 0.25]) % makes small signals more visible 

%% 
% According to Anna WÃ¥hlin, 
% 
% _The missing data at the top is likely due to loss of backscatter signal, 
% caused by too much energy being lost in the water column and/or lack of 
% scatterers in that level. The range of this instrument is about 300 m so 
% it is to be expected. We placed them at the bottom looking upwards in order
% to capture the lower currents - sometimes we place a second ADCP further 
% up in order to get the whole water column but not [at this location]._ 
% 
% Let's zoom in on a few weeks to make the time series more sensible: 

xlim([datenum(2013,1,12) datenum(2013,2,15)])
datetick('x','keeplimits')

%% 
% Above, you can see the tidal signals pulsating the entire water column.

%% Plot mean currents
% Here are the mean zonal and meridional components. (Adding an 0.2 offset
% for display purposes): 

u_mean = mean(u,'omitnan')'; 
v_mean = mean(v,'omitnan')'; 

offset = 0.2; % for display purposes

figure
plot(t,u_mean+offset)
hold on
plot(t,v_mean);
legend('u_{mean}+0.2','v_{mean}')
axis tight
datetick('x','mmm-yyyy')

%% Predict tides
% Get the predicted zonal and meridional components of the tidal current
% at the mooring location: 

% (My) file path to the model file: 
fn = 'CATS2008_update_2022-06-11.nc'; 

% Predict tidal velocities: 
u_pred = tmd_predict(fn,lat,lon,t,'u');  
v_pred = tmd_predict(fn,lat,lon,t,'v'); 

plot(t,u_mean+offset-u_pred)
hold on
plot(t,v_mean-v_pred);
legend('u_{mean}+0.2','v_{mean}','u_{detide}+0.2','v_{detide}')

%%
% Zoom in for clarity: 

xlim([datenum(2013,1,12) datenum(2013,2,15)])
datetick('x','keeplimits')

%% 
% Above, the tidal currents have been removed from the zonal and meridional 
% components of the current. All that remains is the residual water flow
% that isn't driven by tides (and any tidal energy that wasn't perfectly
% accounted for in the CATS model). 

%% Flow into/out of a trough
% Optional: Use Antarctic Mapping Tools and Climate Data Tools to plot a
% map of the area surrounding the mooring, for context: 

figure
mapzoomps(lat,lon,'mapwidth',700) % zooms a map on the mooring
bedmachine('bed') % plots bed depth 
bedmachine % plots grounding line 
hold on
plotps(lat,lon,'yo','linewidth',4) % mooring location
plotps(lat,lon,'ro','linewidth',2) 
caxis([-1 1]*2000)
cmocean topo % CDT topographic colormap
axis off 
shadem(4,[225 80]) % hillshade
graticuleps % lat/lon grid

%% 
% In the map above, we see the north/south motion of the water roughly 
% corresponds to flow out/into trough that leads to Getz Ice Shelf. 
% Here's just the meridional component of ADCP velocity, to show flow into
% and out of the trough: 

figure
pcolor(t,z,v) 
shading interp
cb = colorbar; 
ylabel(cb,'northward flow (m/s)') 
caxis([-1 1]*0.25)
cmocean -balance % colormap 
axis tight
datetick('x','mmm-yyyy')
title 'flow toward/away from Getz'

%% 
% In the time series above, red flows south (toward Getz) while blue flows
% north. Here's a zoom-in:

xlim([datenum(2013,1,12) datenum(2013,2,15)])
datetick('x','keeplimits')

%% 
% And here's the same thing, detided: 

v_detide = v - v_pred'; 

figure
pcolor(t,z,v_detide) 
shading interp
cb = colorbar; 
ylabel(cb,'northward flow (m/s)') 
caxis([-1 1]*0.25)
cmocean -balance % colormap 
axis tight
xlim([datenum(2013,1,12) datenum(2013,2,15)])
datetick('x','keeplimits')
title 'detided flow toward/away from Getz'

%% Baroclinic flow
% Until now, we've applied the mean predicted tidal currents to the entire
% water column. In reality, the strength of any water flow in the ocean is
% a function of depth. Here's the mean meridional velocity at this mooring:

v_barotropic = mean(v,2,'omitnan'); 

figure
plot(v_barotropic,z)
box off 
axis tight
xlabel 'meridional velocity (m/s)'
ylabel 'depth (m)' 
title 'mean meridional flow' 

%% 
% The plot above shows that mean flow is negative (southward, or toward
% Getz) throughout the entire water column, but is particularly strong near
% the bottom of the water column. 
% 
% How much of the mean flow is driven by tides? 

v_tidal_mean = mean(v_pred)

%%
% That tiny value of mean tidal velocity tells us that effectively none of the mean
% flow here is driven by tidal forcing. 

%% Water transports versus velocities 
% By default, TMD calculates _transport_ variables (m^2/s), then divides them by
% water column thickness to get barotropic tidal velocity (m/s). If
% bathymetry in the model is inaccurate, then errors in predicted currents
% will scale with the bathymetry error. 
% 
% In this particular case, we know the depth of the mooring, which is 

z(1)

%% 
% How accurate is the model bathymetry at the location of this mooring? 
% Entering the model filename |fn| which we defined above, we can get the
% water column thickness at this location: 

wct_model = tmd_interp(fn,'wct',lat,lon)

%% 
% Just a few meters off! When you account for potential error in the
% mooring depth measurement, and the fact that mooring location may not
% perfectly represent the mean depth of the entire model grid cell, I'd say
% these two values are just about equal. 
% 
% If you ever encounter a case where the water column thickness in the model 
% is drastically different from the known wct, I recommend predicting the
% _transport_ (capital U and V), then divide by your known wct.
