%% How to: Calculate tidal range
% This page describes the surprisingly tricky problem of calculating the
% full range of tidal motion. 

%% Method 1: Quick approximation 
% The quick-and-dirty approach to calculating tidal range is simply to add
% up the amplitudes of all of the constituents. For example, the
% |TPXO9_atlas_v5.nc| file contains 15 constituents that each oscillate as
% sinusoids of different frequencies. If we ignore the patterns of constructive and
% descrutive interference that occur when sinusoids of different frequencies are 
% added together, we can say the peak-to-peak tidal range is 2 times the
% sum of the amplitudes of all of the constituents. 
% 
% Below, we load a global cube of tidal height amplitudes of all
% constituents, then sum them. The |earthimage| function is from the <https://github.com/chadagreene/CDT
% Climate Data Toolbox for MATLAB> and is purely optional. 

% Load data (takes a few seconds for TPXO9)
[h,lon,lat] = tmd_data('TPXO9_atlas_v5.nc','hAm'); 
ocean = tmd_data('TPXO9_atlas_v5.nc','mask'); 

% Peak-to-Peak tidal range: 
h_range = 2*sum(h,3);

him = imagesc(lon,lat,h_range);
him.AlphaData = ocean; 
axis xy image off
caxis([0 7])
cb = colorbar; 
ylabel(cb,'peak-to-peak tidal range (m)')
earthimage('bottom','centerlon',180) % optional 

%% Minor constituents 
% In the example above, we've ignored minor constituents, which can add
% about 5 to 10% extra variability that isn't accounted for among the major
% constituents, so if you're trying to estimate tidal range as I've shown above,
% you might want to multiply |h_range| by 1.1 to account for minor
% constituents, although that won't capture all of the variability
% exactly. 

%% The problem with the simple sum 
% In the example above, we've just summed the amplitudes of 15
% constituents, multiplied that by two, and called it the peak-to-peak
% range. However, in reality, the sinusoids add together destructively at
% times, and so the simple sum of all constituent amplitudes can give the
% impression that tidal ranges are a little bit bigger than they really
% are. Consider this location in the <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_of_Fundy 
% Bay of Fundy>, which boasts the biggest tidal range in the world: 

% A spot in the bay:
lati = 45.3333;
loni = 295.533;

% Using the |h_range| grid we calculated above, we can interpolate to get the 
% full tidal range in the Bay of Fundy: 

h_rangei = interp2(lon,lat,h_range,loni,lati)

%% 
% 17.6 m is slightly larger than the 16 m mentioned on the <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_of_Fundy
% Wikipedia page for Bay of Fundy> - _Why might that be?_  Well, for one thing, I'm not
% entirely sure where in the bay the 16 m value was measured, and for
% another thing, it's unclear what exactly they mean by the full tidal
% range. 
% 
% For context, let's plot the time series of tides at the location of
% interest. We'll plot an entire year of data at one-minute temporal
% resolution: 

t = datetime('jan 1, 2020'):minutes(1):datetime('jan 1, 2021');

% Above, you see the pulsing of the fortnightly tides that dominate the
% overall envelope, but it's worth noting that not all two-week intervals
% look the same. The tides do not come close to their maximum or minimum values in
% all of January or February. That's because the timing of the peaks of all
% of the different sinusoidal constituents don't always coincide, so they
% interfere destructively. Also note that the prediction from the
% |tmd_predict| function infers an extra dozen or so minor constituents
% that aren't explicitly included in the TPXO9 model. 
% 
% Here's the peak-to-peak tidal range from one year of the predicted time
% series: 

hi_range = max(hi)-min(hi)

%% 
% That's a meter less than we calculated by the simple sum of major
% constituent amplitudes, because over the course of a year, all of the
% peaks of all of the constituents never coincide all at once. 

%% Method 2: Slow and inelegant 
% Above, we saw how the simple sum of major constituent amplitudes provides
% a sort-of-okay-but-not-perfect estimate of tidal ranges. We'd get a
% more accurate solution if we could compute the time series for every single 
% pixel, but that comes at a high computational cost. 
% 
% TMD3.0 includes a semi-documented |tidal_range| function that calculates
% tidal range maps, including minor constituents, but I give you this
% warning that it is _slow_! 
% 
% By default, the |tidal_range| function predicts tides at 30 minute
% intervals for a year. It can take several hours to run, and even still,
% it might not capture the full tidal range, for two reasons: 
% 
% # *Length of the solution:* In the time series we plotted in the example
% above, it's fair to wonder, _would the tidal constituents add together
% differently in a different year, and produce a slightly different tidal
% range?_ The answer is, probably, yes. So we must accept that the tidal
% range over the course of 2020 may not be exactly the same as the tidal
% range in 2021. 
% # *Temporal resolution:* In the example above, we predicted and plotted
% the tidal time series at one-minute temporal resolution. That did a
% pretty good job of capturing the peaks and valleys of the time series,
% but even still, the true tidal maximum probably occurs between timesteps,
% so we didn't capture the full tidal range. The |tidal_range| function
% predicts tides at 30 minute resolution, so it's even worse! However, 30
% minutes is still sufficient to capture the overall shape of the diurnal
% tides, so I only recommend changing the temporal resolution of the
% |tidal_range| function to minutely if you want the solution to take 30
% times as long, for a marginal difference in tidal range value.
% Nonetheless, if you'd like to adjust the duration or temporal resolution
% of the |tidal_range| output, you may: 
% 
%  open tidal_range
% 
%% 
% And then edit this line accordingly: 
% 
%  % A year of 30 minute timesteps: 
%  t = (datenum(2000,1,1):1/48:datenum(2001,1,1))';
%
%% Method 3: Efficient, exact analytic solution 
% I am certain that there's an analytic solution to this problem of adding
% a bunch of sinusoids of various amplitudes and frequencies. (Because it's a simple 
% problem, right?) Such a solution would provide an exact and accurate value 
% of the total tidal range. However, my brain is too simple to figure it
% out on my own, so if you figure it out yourself, will ya let me know?
